For the final project, we completed a basic Message Board instead of Olgun's propose.  In this Message Board, all users are able to view posts and comments on website.  But only logged in users can post or comments on them.  Starting from the homepage.php which is the main page for our website.  Users can search posts that are interesting to them based on the author, title, category, or ratings.  Or, they can click on the Category button to explore the contents they like.  Top rated posts are displayed on the homepage as well.  Users can see comment details once click on the “view” button. 

If users want to log in, they can also choose to register in the log in page. That directs them to create a user profile.  User can choose one from four default profile picture, and basic information is asked for creating an account.  SQL database updates, inserts or deletes whenever there’s a query regarding to data that passed by the user. 

Users can also visit their profile page to view their general information when registered account.  They can modify a new password in this page.  In addition, if they have admin accounts, they have the “admin page” button shows up.  Users can be banned and posts can be deleted in “admin page”. 

If the users search for contents by searchbox, it directs them to search result page, which displays a table on all post, results.  Similarly, if one of the Category button is clicked, users will enter “catpage.php”, which is a search result page for selected category. 

SQLtools.php and config.php are the helper page for linking database to our webpages.  SQLtools.php has additional useful functions to create tables and so on.  Our “messageboard” database contains three tables: “comments”, “posts”, “users”.  Each comment is assigned a pointer to the post they distribute.  Each post and user has a unique id and username for easier accessing.  Overall, we pretty much accomplished all the goals that we sat up.  It is a very fun and meaningful project.  Hope you enjoy it as much as we do.
